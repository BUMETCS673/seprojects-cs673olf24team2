# Project: Rent & Housing Platform

## Project Introduction:
The Rent & Housing Platform is a web application designed to streamline the housing search process for students. Whether they are looking for shared apartments, individual rental properties, or housing information, our platform offers a seamless and efficient user experience
Key features include user registration and management, posting and searching rental listings, and collecting rental details.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this web application are to:
- User Registration and Profile Management: Students can create accounts, manage their profiles, and save listings.
- Rental Listings: Users can post, browse, and filter rental properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and property type.
- Advanced Search and Filtering: Our platform allows students to search properties using filters like price range, proximity to universities, and property amenities.
- Real-time Performance Enhancements: our platform ensures fast and efficient data access, providing users with quick responses and real-time updates.
- Scalable and Reliable Backend: Built using Java and powered by DynamoDB, the system is designed to handle large volumes of data while maintaining performance, ensuring the platform can grow as more users join.
